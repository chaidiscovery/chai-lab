# Adding MSA evolutionary information

While Chai-1 performs very well in "single-sequence mode," it can also be given additional evolutionary information to further improve performance. As in other folding methods, this evolutionary information is provided in the form of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). This information is given in the form of a `MSAContext` object (see `chai_lab/data/dataset/msas/msa_context.py`); we provide code for building these `MSAContext` objects through `aligned.pqt` files, though you can play with building out an `MSAContext` yourself as well. 

Multiple strategies can be used for generating MSAs. In our [technical report](https://chaiassets.com/chai-1/paper/technical_report_v1.pdf), we generated MSAs using [jackhmmer](https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer). Other algorithms such as [MMseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2) can also be used.  We provide an example of how to generate MSAs using [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold) in `examples/msas/predict_with_msas.py`. Performance will vary depending on the input MSA databases and search algorithms used.

## The `.aligned.pqt` file format

The easiest way to provide MSA information to Chai-1 is through the `.aligned.pqt` file format that we have defined. This file can be thought of as an augmented `a3m` file, and is essentially a dataframe saved in parquet format with the following four (required) columns:

- `sequence` - contains alignment hits in the `a3m` sequence format. 
- `source_database` - contains information regarding the database that the sequence came from. This can be set to one of `uniprot`, `uniref90`, `bfd_uniclust`, `mgnify`, or `query`. This source is featurized as an input to Chai-1 (and is therefore not just for book keeping!). The `query` key should only occur once in the table as the first row and indicates the query sequence used to construct the hits. If your alignments come from a database not included in these four options, it's probably a good idea to experiment with setting a source to get best results; `uniref90` should be a good "catchall" choice in general. 
- `pairing_key` - a string that indicates a "key" for how alignments for different sequences in a complex should be "paired" up with each other (similarly to AlphaFold-Multimer and AlphaFold 3) to capture evolutionary information across chains. Pairing is done across all sequences with the same pairing key. Therefore, while this pairing key is typically set to a species identifier, you might want to consider setting it to some other key that provides a more or less general grouping by which to match up MSA alignments across different sequences. 
- `comment` - the wild west. You may put whatever string you choose here and it will be ignored; this field is provided primarily for human readability and book keeping. 

This file format offers several advantages over standard `.a3m` files:
- Alignments that come from different databases can be contained in a single file without losing track of which alignment came from where. Note, however, that all rows in this file are assumed to be associated with the same (indicated) query sequence. 
- Allows flexible specification of how sequences across different chains ought to be paired up.

See the following for a toy example of what this table might look like:

| sequence | source_database | pairing_key  | comment                       |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| RKDSS... | query           |              | query sequence                |
| RKDES... | uniref90        |              | A fun sequence from uniref90  |
| RKSES... | uniprot         | Mus musculus | A mouse sequence from uniprot |
| ...      |

We additionally provide example code to parse `a3m` files into this format; see `merge_multi_a3m_to_aligned_dataframe` in `chai_lab/data/parsing/msas/aligned_pqt.py`. This file can also be run as a commandline script; run `python chai_lab/data/parsing/msas/aligned_pqt.py --help` for details. Note, however, that this code defaults to only parsing pairing keys based on species annotation in UniProt files; this follows the logic described in both AlphaFold3 and AlphaFold2 multimer. To specify pairing keys for different data sources, or to use something other than species as the pairing key, we encourage users to build their own parsing logic to create `.aligned.pqt` files.

### TLDR

Chai-1 uses `.aligned.pqt` files to specify MSAs. These are similar to `a3m` with added columns for source database and pairing key to pair MSAs across different chains. Each `.aligned.pqt` file contains all MSAs for a single query sequence. 

## From `.aligned.pqt` to `MSAContext`

By default, the `run_inference` example inference code we provide assumes that all MSAs required for a prediction are stored in a specified folder. Each `.aligned.pqt` file in that folder corresponds to the all MSA alignments for a given sequence (spanning several databases), and filenames are specified by the hash of their sequence (this filename is inferred using code in `chai_lab/data/parsing/msas/aligned_pqt.py`). During inference, the script tries to find `<HASH>.aligned.pqt` files in that folder (one file per unique chain sequence) and loads in a `MSAContext` for each MSA it can find. The code then performs some basic preprocessing such as pairing MSAs by their given `pairing_key` and merging MSAs across chains; see `chai_lab/data/dataset/msas/load.py` for details. 

## Putting it all together

To demonstrate how these pieces tie together, we provide `aligned.pqt` files containing MSAs for the example in `examples/predict_structure.py` under the `examples/msas` folder. Inference can be run using these example MSAs by providing the path to this folder as an additional argument to `run_inference` as follows:

```python
from pathlib import Path
...

candidates = run_inference(
    ...
    msa_directory=Path("examples/msas"),
    ...
)
```

You can also manually inspect the example `aligned.pqt` files by loading them as pandas dataframes as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd

aligned_pqt = pd.read_parquet("examples/msas/703adc2c74b8d7e613549b6efcf37126da7963522dc33852ad3c691eef1da06f.aligned.pqt")
aligned_pqt.head()
```
